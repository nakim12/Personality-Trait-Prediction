# Personality Trait Prediction: Facial Feature Extraction Project
A Streamlit app that turns a single frontal selfie into three quick trait estimates: compassion percentage, estimated testosterone (ng/dL), and an intelligence-level proxy to determine male partner compatiblity. It uses MediaPipe to pull seven simple facial measurements—like width-to-height ratio and micro-expression angles—and feeds them into lightweight models that run in under 200 ms. Every prediction shows its confidence score and the raw fWHR, making it clear how basic geometry can reveal meaningful hormone and prosocial signals in real time.
